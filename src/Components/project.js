Using my skills in software development, I created a machine learning model that uses transaction features to alert you to potential fraud. I have experience in using the latest technologies to make sure that the system is trained to achieve a high level of accuracy in identifying any risks. The linear regression algorithm that I use ensures that the model is constantly learning and improving.
